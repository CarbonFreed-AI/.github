# Accelerating the Energy Transition with AI

To achieve the climate goals, we need to take action. That's why, in 2020, we founded CarbonFreed. Since our inception, we've been working tirelessly towards our mission of advancing the decarbonization of the Earth's atmosphere and preserving our planet as a habitable space. Our focus lies in the certification of photovoltaic installations.

## gridcert as Relief for Certification Bodies

We are not embarking on this journey alone but together with our AI-powered platform, gridcert. We developed this software to digitize the process of connecting large-scale photovoltaic installations to the grid. Thanks to state-of-the-art machine learning technologies and improved information pathways, the processing time is significantly reduced: Instead of months as previously, installations can now be connected to the power grid in just 14 days. gridcert generates a certifiable and standardized dataset that simplifies the certification procedures, eliminates additional iterations, and guarantees a smooth flow of project audits.

On the path to greater renewable energy, alongside the use of artificial intelligence, we particularly value:

* A good work-life balance through Remote Only
* Regular team events
* Teamwork and appreciation
* Openness to new ideas
* Revenue sharing
